    Also owns a single, long-lived `httpx.AsyncClient`, built here alongside
    the semaphore. A per-question client would throw away connection pooling
    between questions and re-pay client construction every time, so it is
    built once at composition time, off the query path, over the

    needs no running event loop — the pool binds to one on first request —
