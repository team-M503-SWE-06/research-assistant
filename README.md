## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/team-M503-SWE-06/research-assistant
cd research-assistant
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate          # Windows; use `source .venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure
copy .env.example .env          # `cp .env.example .env` on macOS/Linux, then fill in real API keys
# DO NOT commit .env — it is already in .gitignore

# 3. Run the tests
pytest tests/test_ai_smoke.py -v                          # provided, graded smoke tests
pytest --cov=researcher --cov-report=term-missing          # full suite with coverage

# 4. Run the demo (needs LLM + web-search API keys in .env)
python -m researcher demo
python -m researcher ask "What is CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing?"
```

Offline sanity checks that need no API keys at all:

```bash
python demo_ai.py --offline          # exercises the provided ai/ package with canned data
pytest tests/test_ai_smoke.py -v     # all 16 tests, no network
```

## Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t research-assistant .

# Default command: runs all 5 sample questions end-to-end
docker run --env-file .env research-assistant

# Override the command to ask a single question (no ENTRYPOINT is set, so
# pass the full command, not just the subcommand):
docker run --env-file .env research-assistant python -m researcher ask "What is CRISPR?" --no-cache

# Run the graded smoke tests inside the container
docker run --env-file .env research-assistant pytest tests/test_ai_smoke.py -v
```

## CLI usage

```bash
python -m researcher ask "How does CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing work?"
python -m researcher ask "What is fusion energy?" --no-cache
python -m researcher ask "What is photosynthesis?" --sources wiki,arxiv
python -m researcher demo --limit 3
```

Sample output:

```
Q: What is photosynthesis and what are its main stages?

A: Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into
chemical energy [1]. The reaction takes place in the chloroplasts and
produces oxygen as a byproduct [2].

(timing: wikipedia=0.42s, arxiv=0.61s, web=0.38s; * = cache hit)
```

## Sequential vs concurrent benchmark

```bash
python scripts/bench.py --limit 5
```

| Workload | N | Sequential | Concurrent | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 sample research questions (run 2, all sources healthy) | 5 | 46.8s | 11.7s | 4.0x |
| 5 sample research questions (run 1, one arXiv 10 s timeout in the sequential phase) | 5 | 71.6s | 11.8s | 6.1x |

`scripts/bench.py` runs the same N questions once with a plain `for` loop and once via `asyncio.gather`, both with `--no-cache` semantics so the numbers reflect real fetch/synthesis concurrency, not cache hits. Measured 2026-09-12 against this codebase (the figures predate the move to this repository; the measured code is unchanged) on a Windows 11 laptop with Python 3.14.3, `LLM_MODEL=claude-opus-5` and Tavily web search. Synthesis is ~91% of the sequential time, so the concurrent run is bounded by the slowest single question (~1–2 s of fetches plus ~10 s of LLM), not by the semaphore. Running `python -m researcher demo` twice gave 0/15 source-cache hits on the first pass and 15/15 on the second.

**Expected bottleneck:** each `ask` call fans out 3 I/O-bound fetches (Wikipedia, arXiv, web search) concurrently via `asyncio.gather`, so a single call's wall time is bounded by the *slowest* of the three, not their sum — `researcher/concurrency/orchestrator.py` and `tests/test_orchestrator.py::test_sources_fetched_in_parallel_not_sequentially` demonstrate this at the unit level with staggered fake delays. Running multiple `ask` calls concurrently (as the benchmark does) additionally amortizes each call's fixed overhead (LLM synthesis latency, connection setup) across the batch; the `MAX_CONCURRENT_FETCHES` semaphore caps how much of that can happen in parallel before the LLM provider's own rate limits become the bottleneck.

## Testing

```bash
pytest --cov=researcher --cov-report=term-missing
```

- Total coverage on `researcher/`: **95%** (435 statements, 22 missed; ≥60% required, enforced in CI by `--cov-fail-under=60`)
- Provided `tests/test_ai_smoke.py`: **16/16 passing, unmodified**
- **90 tests total** (74 own + 16 provided), all offline — no test touches the live network. `ai.*` calls are mocked via `unittest.mock`/`monkeypatch`; HTTP-layer tests can additionally use `respx`.
- Concurrency is specifically exercised in `tests/test_orchestrator.py`: parallel fan-out timing, graceful degradation when one source raises, per-source timeout isolation, semaphore-bounded concurrency, and cache-hit short-circuiting.
- `ruff check .` and `mypy researcher/` both pass; configuration lives in `pyproject.toml`. Both tools exclude the provided `ai/`, `demo_ai.py` and `tests/test_ai_smoke.py`, which carry pre-existing findings in files the assignment's contract forbids us to modify.
- Every push and pull request runs lint, type check, tests with the coverage gate, and a Docker build via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Architecture

The CLI hands a validated question to a facade, which delegates to an async orchestrator that fans out to Wikipedia, arXiv, and web search concurrently via `asyncio.gather`. A thin service layer wraps the provided `ai/` package with retries and timing, and a TTL cache sits in front of each source. Exactly one module crosses into `ai/`, and exactly one crosses the storage boundary.

**Boundaries.** Exactly one arrow crosses into the provided `ai/` package (`ai_service.py → ai/`), and exactly one crosses the storage boundary (`cache.py → cache_store.py`); the orchestrator never touches a file. `models.py` (`SourceOutcome`, `ResearchSession`) is the typed payload that travels along every arrow inside `researcher/` — no naked dictionaries cross a module boundary. Swapping the LLM provider changes zero files here: it is `LLM_PROVIDER=...` plus a key, dispatched inside the provided `ai.providers.factory`.

One shared `httpx.AsyncClient` is owned by the orchestrator for its whole lifetime and passed into every `ai.*` fetch, so connections are pooled across questions, not just within one. It is built at composition time over a process-wide SSL context — constructing the trust store costs ~0.35s, which would otherwise be charged to every `ask` call — and released by `Researcher.aclose()` (or `async with researcher:`, which the CLI and benchmark use). Each source's cache check happens before the semaphore is acquired, so cache hits never contend with live fetches for the concurrency budget.

## Limitations

- Only source lists are cached, not final synthesized answers — LLM output isn't deterministic per call, so answer-level caching was out of scope for this assignment's caching requirement.
- Cache expiry is lazy (checked on read); there is no background sweeper removing stale files from `CACHE_DIR`.
- No persistent database — the cache is filesystem JSON, which is sufficient at this scale but wouldn't scale to concurrent multi-process writers.
- Wikipedia's search API matches article titles by prefix, so a full question returns nothing; `AIService.fetch_wikipedia` retries with shorter keyword phrases (`researcher/services/search_terms.py`). The stopword list is tuned on the sample questions, so an unusual question may still get no Wikipedia sources or only a broad article.
